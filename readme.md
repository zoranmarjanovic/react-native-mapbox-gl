# React Native Mapbox GL

_An experimental React Native component for building maps with the [Mapbox iOS SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/) and [Mapbox Android SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/android-sdk/)_

## What is Mapbox?

Mapbox is the location data platform for mobile and web applications. We provide [building blocks](https://www.mapbox.com/products/) to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience you create. Use our simple and powerful APIs & SDKs and our open source libraries for interactivity and control.

## Sign up for Mapbox

Not a Mapbox user yet? [Sign up for an account here](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/). Once youâ€™re signed in, all you need to start building is a Mapbox access token. Use this same short code with all of our interactive mapping libraries, Python and JavaScript SDKs, and directly against our REST APIs. You can [create and manage your access tokens in Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/).

## Support

This project is **experimental**. Mapbox does not officially support React Native Mapbox GL to the same extent as the [iOS](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/) or [Android](https://www.mapbox.com/android-sdk/) SDKs it depends on. Bug reports and pull requests are very welcome.

## Future Official Support
Moving forward a `v6` branch has been created and a rewrite of the library is underway.  This will move the repo out of an experimental state into a stable officially supported state. I've created a Github project called `6.0.0` right now it just has high level tasks, but I plan to break them up into smaller tasks moving forward. Once the base of `v6` is in a good state feature branches will be created off `v6` and PRs will be made against it. If you would like to be involved with the rewrite in any way just let me know! I also created a [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/react-native-mapbox-gl/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) as a place to ask any questions at all about the repo.
